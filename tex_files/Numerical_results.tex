\section{Results and discussion}  
In this section we apply the theory developed in \cite{kalarickel2020well} to 
several different class to problems which could not be managed with the 
previous theory like the one in \cite{bianisotropi_m3as}.
The conditions are established on the parameters of such problems, 
under which the well posedness and finite element 
approximability  can be guaranteed.
Under such condition, the numerical solutions for the fields are 
computed for the first time.
The details of our finite element simulator is the same as that 
described in Section 5 of \cite{kalarickel2020well}.
%In particular let us first consider the class of problems involving materials described in Kraft et al. \cite{pendry2016acsphotonics}.
