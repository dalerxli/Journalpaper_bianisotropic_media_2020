\subsection{Chirowaveguides considered in \cite{wujaggard}}
In \cite{wujaggard}, the authors consider a waveguide partially filled with 
a chiral medial which is characterized by
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
{\bf D} = \varepsilon_0\varepsilon_r I_3 {\bf E} - j \xi_c I_3 {\bf B} \\
{\bf H} = -j\xi_c I_3 {\bf E} + \frac{1}{\mu_0\mu_r} I_3 {\bf B}.
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

Here $\varepsilon_r$, $\mu_r$ and $\xi_c$ are strictly positive real quantities.
